in bitcoin all computers store big ledger/database of who owns how many bitcoins(uses proof of work)

ethereum does the same what it does extra is lets you program on top of blockchain

so instead of using aws/ google cloud we could use ethereum that will one be open source ie everyone in the blockchain can see the backend algos
2ndly we would know that this open spurced code backend is the one actually running 

why would we do this ?
so there is no centeralized authority making decisions for us 
like google deciding what to show n what to not as they could show videos promoting a political party and that can have impact.

ETH is moving towards using proof of stake
